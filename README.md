👀 I’m passionate about understanding data, improving business processes, and finding insights that make a difference.
🌱 Right now, I’m diving into advanced SQL and experimenting with machine learning to predict trends and enhance decision-making.
💞️ I’d love to collaborate on projects that involve data analysis, visualization, or anything that helps businesses thrive through insights.
